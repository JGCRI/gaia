# Workflow

<!-------------------------->
<!-------------------------->

<p align="center"><img src="vignetteFigs/divider.png"/></p>


`gaea` is designed with a climate-driven empirical model at its core, integrated into an efficient modular structure. This architecture streamlines the entire workflow, from initial climate and crop data processing through empirical model fitting, yield shock projections under future climate scenarios, to the calculation of agricultural productivity changes for GCAM. The modular design also facilitates comprehensive diagnostic outputs, enhancing the tool's utility for researchers and policymakers.

The primary functionality of `gaea` is encapsulated in the `yield_impact` wrapper function, which executes the entire workflow from climate data processing to yield shock estimation. Users can also execute individual functions to work through the main steps of the process (\autoref{fig:workflow}). Detailed instructions on `gaea` can be accessed at https://jgcri.github.io/gaea.

1. `weighted_climate`: Processes CMIP-ISIMIP climate NetCDF data and calculates cropland-weighted precipitation and temperature at the country level, differentiated by crop type and irrigation type. The function accepts both daily or monthly climate data.

2. `crop_calenders`: Generates crop planting months for each country based on crop calendar data from [Sacks et al., (2020)](https:/doi/org/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2010.00551.x).

3. `data_aggregation`: Calculates crop growing seasons using climate variables processed by `weighted_climate` and crop calendars for both historical and projected periods. This function prepares climate and yield data for subsequent model fitting.

4. `yield_regression`: Performs regression analysis based on historical crop yields and climate variations. The default econometric model applied in `gaea` is from [Waldhoff et al., (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/abadcb). User can provide other formulas as long as it is using the same data from `data_aggregation`.

5. `yield_projection`: Projects yield shocks for future climate scenarios using the fitted model.

6. `gcam_agprodchange`: Remaps country-level yield shocks to GCAM-required spatial scales (i.e., region and basin intersections) based on harvest area and converts crops to GCAM commodities. This function calculates agricultural productivity growth (a key parameter for GCAM to estimate future yield) and creates ready-to-use XML outputs for GCAM.

## Example Climate Data

`gaea` requires global climate data from the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project ([ISIMIP](https://www.isimip.org/)) or data with the same format of ISIMIP data. In addition, `gaea` also allows climate data that has been aggregated to monthly time step. Given the large size of the climate data at daily time step, we have provided an example climate data at monthly time step from 2015 to 2100 ((download link)[]). Please download the data and make sure to unzip the data to your desired location.

<div class="alert alert-info">
<strong>NOTE:</strong> In the case where there is no available historical climate data, `gaea` will use the default fitted model that has already been fitted with WATCH historical climate forcing data ([Weedon et al., (2011)](https://doi.org/10.1175/2011JHM1369.1)).

## Run gaea!

Once the example data is in place, we can run `gaea` with a single function `yield_impact` that streamlines the entire workflow. For the explanation of each argument of `yield_impact`, refer to this [reference page](https://jgcri.github.io/gaea/reference/yield_impact.html).



```{r eval=FALSE}

# load gaea
library(gaea)

# NOTE: please change `data_dir` to your desired location for downloaded data
data_dir <- gaea::get_example_data(
  download_url = 'https://zenodo.org/records/13179630/files/gaea_example_climate.zip?download=1',

# Path to the climate NetCDF files

# historical climate data

  start_year = 2015,                      # start year of the projected climate data
  end_year = 2100,                        # end year of the projected climate data
  smooth_window = 20,                     # number of years as smoothing window
  co2_hist = NULL,                        # historical annual CO2 concentration. If NULL, will use default value
  co2_proj = NULL,                        # projected annual CO2 concentration. If NULL, will use default value
  diagnostics = TRUE,                     # set to TRUE to output diagnostic plots

<div class="alert alert-info">
<strong>NOTE:</strong> The arguments `climate_model`, `climate_scenario`, `member`, `bias_adj`, and `cfe` require corresponding strings that demonstrate climate model information in the output files. These arguments will not affect `gaea` model simulation, other than the meta information of climate data in the output files.
