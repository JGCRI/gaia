title = {Future climate impacts on global agricultural yields over the 21st century},
journal = {Environmental Research Letters},
abstract = {Analyses of the future impacts of changing crop yields on agricultural production, prices, food security, and GDP growth using Integrated Assessment models require country-level yield shocks due to changing weather conditions, for a wide range of crops and warming scenarios. We characterize impacts of different climate futures on crop yields for individual countries and years. We use historical crop yield and weather data to empirically estimate annual crop yield responses to temperature and precipitation, constructing reduced-form statistical models that are then coupled with earth system model outputs for the same variables to project future yields. Our main result is a panel of annual shocks to yields of 12 crops (cassava, cotton, maize, potatoes, rice, sorghum, soybean, sugar beet, sugarcane, sunflower, and winter and spring wheat) for 58–136 countries, depending on the crop, through 2099, under moderate and vigorous warming scenarios. We find that global yield impacts by century’s end (2086–2095) are − 2%, − 19%, − 14%, and − 1%, without the CO2 fertilization effect (CFE), for maize, rice, soybean, and wheat, respectively, with similar global values with CFE. However, the global and decadal averages mask regional and year-to-year differences that may have large economic consequences, which IAMs could more fully address by representing agricultural yield impacts through the parameters supplied by our study.}

abstract = {To support global-scale assessments that are sensitive to agricultural land use, we developed the global data set of monthly irrigated and rainfed crop areas around the year 2000 (MIRCA2000). With a spatial resolution of 5 arc min (about 9.2 km at the equator), MIRCA2000 provides both irrigated and rainfed crop areas of 26 crop classes for each month of the year. The data set covers all major food crops as well as cotton. Other crops are grouped into categories (perennial, annual, and fodder grasses). It represents multicropping systems and maximizes consistency with census-based national and subnational statistics. According to MIRCA2000, 25\% of the global harvested areas are irrigated, with a cropping intensity (including fallow land) of 1.12, as compared to 0.84 for the sum of rainfed and irrigated harvested crops. For the dominant crops (rice (1.7 million km2 harvested area), wheat (2.1 million km2), and maize (1.5 million km2)), roughly 60\%, 30\%, and 20\% of the harvested areas are irrigated, respectively, and half of the citrus, sugar cane, and cotton areas. While wheat and maize are the crops with the largest rainfed harvested areas (1.5 million km2 and 1.2 million km2, respectively), rice is clearly the crop with the largest irrigated harvested area (1.0 million km2), followed by wheat (0.7 million km2) and maize (0.3 million km2). Using MIRCA2000, 33\% of global crop production and 44\% of total cereal production were determined to come from irrigated agriculture.},

abstract = {Crop models are essential tools for analysing the effects of climate variability, change on crop growth and development and the potential impact of adaptation strategies. Despite their increasing usage, crop model estimations have implicit uncertainties which are difficult to classify and quantify. Failure to address these uncertainties may result in poor advice to policymakers and stakeholders for the development of adaptation strategies. Since the 1990s, the number of crop model uncertainty assessments that consider different sources of model uncertainty (model structure, model parameters and model inputs such as climate, soil, and crop management practices) has increased significantly. We present the outcomes of a systematic review focused on uncertainty assessments of crop model outputs (mainly grain yield) and crop model uncertainty decomposition. We reviewed 277 articles from 1991 to 2019 which included studies conducted in 82 countries (460 locations) across all continents. 57% of the articles have been published between 2015 and 2019. 52% of the studies focus on input uncertainty assessments with climate change projections as the most frequently considered source of input uncertainty. Only 28% and 20% of the studies, respectively, dealt with uncertainties related to model parameters and model structure. The latter was mainly quantified using multi-model ensembles. Over half the studies were carried out in European and Asian countries, 34% and 23%, respectively. Most articles estimated model uncertainty focusing on the grain yield of major cereal crops (wheat > maize > rice) using the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) model. Sensitivity analysis was the most used technique to quantify the contribution of different sources of uncertainty although the range of approaches for uncertainty quantification was wide. There is a need for standard procedures to estimate crop model uncertainty and evaluate estimates. We discuss the challenges of quantifying the components of uncertainty within crop models and identify research needs to better understand sources of uncertainty and thus improve the accuracy of crop models.}

abstract = {The decision support system for agrotechnology transfer (DSSAT) has been in use for the last 15 years by researchers worldwide. This package incorporates models of 16 different crops with software that facilitates the evaluation and application of the crop models for different purposes. Over the last few years, it has become increasingly difficult to maintain the DSSAT crop models, partly due to fact that there were different sets of computer code for different crops with little attention to software design at the level of crop models themselves. Thus, the DSSAT crop models have been re-designed and programmed to facilitate more efficient incorporation of new scientific advances, applications, documentation and maintenance. The basis for the new DSSAT cropping system model (CSM) design is a modular structure in which components separate along scientific discipline lines and are structured to allow easy replacement or addition of modules. It has one Soil module, a Crop Template module which can simulate different crops by defining species input files, an interface to add individual crop models if they have the same design and interface, a Weather module, and a module for dealing with competition for light and water among the soil, plants, and atmosphere. It is also designed for incorporation into various application packages, ranging from those that help researchers adapt and test the CSM to those that operate the DSSAT–CSM to simulate production over time and space for different purposes. In this paper, we describe this new DSSAT–CSM design as well as approaches used to model the primary scientific components (soil, crop, weather, and management). In addition, the paper describes data requirements and methods used for model evaluation. We provide an overview of the hundreds of published studies in which the DSSAT crop models have been used for various applications. The benefits of the new, re-designed DSSAT–CSM will provide considerable opportunities to its developers and others in the scientific community for greater cooperation in interdisciplinary research and in the application of knowledge to solve problems at field, farm, and higher levels.}
