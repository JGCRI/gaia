# gaia 2.0.1

`gaia` is a powerful and user-friendly tool designed to estimate crop yield responses to climate impacts, enabling robust projections and streamlined workflows. Explore its full capabilities in the [User Guide](https://jgcri.github.io/gaia/articles/vignette.html).

## Key Features of `gaia`:

### General Features:

* **Empirical Econometric Modeling:** Estimate annual crop yield responses to climate impacts using an empirically grounded approach.
* **Streamlined Workflow:** Simplify your analysis with a single wrapper function, `yield_impact`, for running models efficiently.
* **Integrated Climate Data Processing:** Process widely-used ISIMIP-style climate NetCDF files without the need for external tools.
* **Data-Driven Insights:** Leverage historical weather, CO2, and crop yield data for robust model fitting.
* **Future Projections:** Project annual yield shocks for 17 crops using CMIP/ISIMIP bias-adjusted precipitation and temperature datasets. `gaia` supports both daily and monthly climate data formats.
* **Flexible Crop Coverage:** Estimate yield shocks for 17 major crops, with the option to add more crops by providing appropriate input data.
* **Model Supports:** Designed to support [Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM)](https://github.com/JGCRI/gcam-core) as well as other non-GCAM modeling frameworks.


### GCAM-Specific Features:
* **Ready-to-Use Outputs:** Generate XML files for agricultural productivity changes at region-basin intersections, compatible with GCAM.
* **Version Compatibility:** Supports GCAM v6.x and v7.x.
* **Flexible Time Steps:** Offer options for both 5-year and annual time steps for GCAM.
* **Scenario Flexibility:** Choose from various Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) in combination with climate scenarios (e.g., RCPs).
